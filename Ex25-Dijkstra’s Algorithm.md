# Ex25 Finding the Fastest Route to a Charging Station using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## DATE:
11.11.2025

## AIM:
To design and implement a Java program that helps an electric vehicle (EV) find the shortest travel time from its current block to the nearest charging station using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.

## Algorithm
1. Read number of blocks (nodes) and roads (edges) with travel times (weights).  
2. Build a weighted adjacency list for the graph.  
3. Read the list of charging station nodes.  
4. Run Dijkstra’s algorithm from the EV’s current location to compute shortest distances to all nodes.  
5. Find the minimum distance among all charging stations.  
6. Output the fastest route travel time and the corresponding charging station.
